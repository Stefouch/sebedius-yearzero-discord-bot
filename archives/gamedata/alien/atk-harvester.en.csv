1;SONAR SWEEP;;;3;The Harvester takes in its surroundings by singing out a quick sonar pulse. Add **+1** to the next roll on this table (for a maximum of 6). All PCs at up to `LONG` range are affected by the high-pitched squeal and get **+1** `STRESS LEVEL`.
2;SONAR PULSE;;;1;The Harvester uses its sonar as a weapon. Everyone within `SHORT` range gets blasted by the ultra-sonic burst and must make a `STAMINA` roll (no action) or be stunned and lose their next action. Those who are not stunned must make a __Panic Roll__.
3;CHARGE;10;1;0;The cornered Harvester rushes the player who it deems to be the biggest threat. It makes a manic charge against them, and all those in that direction, as its charge crosses into the next zone. All targets must make a `MOBILITY` roll (no action) to get out of the way. Anyone who fails suffers an attack rolled with __**ten** Base Dice, Damage **1**__, and is knocked prone.
4;STAMPEDE;6;2;1;The Harvester goes berserk, like a bucking bronco, and flails around in a maddened frenzy. All targets within `SHORT` range suffer a crushing attack of __**six** Base Dice, Damage **2**__, and are knocked prone if hit.
5;BURROWING CLAWS;10;2;0;The beast’s claws are almost as bad as its maw, and it leaps on a poor victim. They suffer an attack with __**ten** Base Dice, Damage **2**__.
6;PULVERIZE;10;;0;The victim is dragged into the beast’s dreadful meat-grinder of a mouth. They get to make a last-ditch opposed `CLOSE COMBAT` roll against __**eight** Base Dice__ (no action), to dodge that dreadful fate. If they fail the roll they die, their body mercilessly minced, their agonized screams ringing in the ears of their friends until the day they die. All who witness this receive **+1** `STRESS LEVEL` and must make a __Panic Roll__.
