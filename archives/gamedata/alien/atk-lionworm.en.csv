1;INTIMIDATING DISPLAY;;;1;;The Lion Worm rears up, its golden cilia flowing in threatening patterns. But it’s a bluff. The expert predator has seen a problem and is using an aggressive display to cover a tactical retreat (which it makes on its next action). All PCs within `SHORT` range must make a __Panic Roll__. But the Lion Worm is not giving up the hunt: when it retreats, stealth mode resumes with the Lion Worm still hunting the PCs. When it makes its next attack, it gets a **+1** to its roll on this table (to a maximum of 6).
2;PLAY WITH ITS PREY;8;;0;;The Lion Worm attacks but for fun, rather than to kill. Roll for the attack with __**eight** Base Dice__. If the attack hits, the target is knocked to the ground and drops all hand-held items, but is otherwise unharmed. The Worm rears over them, wishing for its prey to run before it attacks again. The victim must make an immediate __Panic Roll__.
3;ACRID PHEROMONES;;;1;;The Lion Worm releases a huge dump of pheromones into the air. They are so pungent that anyone near the creature starts to cough and all PCs within `SHORT` range must make a `STAMINA` roll. If unsuccessful they are stunned and lose their next slow action.
4;FERAL RAGE;10;2;0;;The beast attacks, throwing everything at its victim, with __**ten** Base Dice, Damage **2**__. If it causes any damage, its insatiable desire to kill allows it to immediately make a __second attack__ as a free action, with the same number of Base Dice and Damage rating.
5;CRIPPLING ATTACK;8;1;0;56;The Lion Worm attacks to incapacitate its target, either to eat later or get enough space to escape a bad situation. It goes for a crippling blow, making an attack with __**eight** Base Dice, Damage **1**__. If it does any damage it automatically inflicts __critical injury **#56**__, even if the victim isn’t Broken.
6;DEATH ROLL;10;1;0;;The Lion Worm goes full out for the kill, grasping its target and wrapping it in a vicious death roll. Roll for the attack with __**ten** Base Dice, Damage **1**__. If the attack hits, the victim is grappled as well as disorientated and loses their next slow action. On its next action, the Lion Worm will squeeze the victim, attacking with __**ten** Base Dice, Damage **1**__ again.
