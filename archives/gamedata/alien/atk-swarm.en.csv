1;CONSUME;;;;;The Swarm consumes everything in its path, and this place is rich in food. The Swarm’s Health is restored by **2** points, making it harder to drive off.
2;PHEROMONES;;;;;The Swarm is getting increasingly agitated and more and more pheromones are being released into the air. The Swarm’s next roll on this table gets **+1**. This effect is cumulative.
3;SUFFOCATING SWARM;;;0;;The swarming creatures are everywhere: the air is thick with them. They are in the victims’ eyes, ears and mouths, and it is almost impossible to breathe. Everyone inside the Swarm area must make a `STAMINA` roll. Failure means the victim cannot act during the next Round, and the Swarm will perform a **STRIPPED TO THE BONE** (n°6) attack against the victim as its next action.
4;DESPERATE HUNGER;8;1;0;;The Swarm is so hungry it will eat anything, and right now the polymers and compounds in the players’ armor look good. Everyone within the Swarm wearing armor suffers an attack rolled with __**eight** Base Dice, Damage **1**__. Any damage is immediately subtracted from the Armor Rating. Those not wearing armor find their clothes have been shredded, but the attack does not inflict any damage.
5;FEEDING FRENZY;6;1;0;;The Swarm is hungry and tries to eat anything it can envelope. All characters inside the Swarm suffer an attack rolled with __**six** Base Dice, Damage **1**__. Armor is halved (rounded down) as the creatures look for ways to slip past it.
6;STRIPPED TO THE BONE;8;1;0;true;The Swarm focuses on one target, and that victim takes an attack rolled with __**eight** Base Dice, Damage **1**__. Armor is halved (rounded down) as the creatures squirm underneath it. If the attack inflicts any damage the Swarm has ravaged the victim and they suffer a __critical injury__, even if not Broken. Each Round thereafter one of the Swarm’s actions is automatically to attack this target again with this attack, on the Swarm’s next initiative. This will continue until the victim is stripped to the bone, rescued, or the Swarm is driven off.
