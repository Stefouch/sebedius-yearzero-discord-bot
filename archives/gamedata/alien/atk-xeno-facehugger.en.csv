1-2;SKITTERING MENACE;;;;The Facehugger has chosen its host and they know it is coming for them! It skitters forward, single-minded and horrifyingly spider-like. The victim suffers **+1** `STRESS LEVEL` and must make an immediate __Panic Roll__.
3;TAIL LASH;5;1;0;The little monster comes for its target, lashing out with its wicked tail. It attacks with __**five** Base Dice, Damage **1**__. *(The Royal Facehugger uses six Base Dice, base Damage 2.)* Aside from any damage the victim gets **+1** `STRESS LEVEL`.
4;TAIL GRAPPLE;1;;0;The Facehugger leaps and catches its victim from behind, its tail whipping violently. Roll a D6:\n> **1–2:** The target’s legs are caught and they fall prone—make a __Panic Roll__.\n> **3–4:** The victim’s arms get hopelessly tangled in the beast’s tail—they cannot use any held items and must make a __Panic Roll__.\n> **5–6:** The Facehugger wraps its tail around the target’s neck, choking them—they suffer the effects of `DROWNING` and must make a __Panic Roll__.
5;FACE GRAPPLE;6;;0;The Facehugger leaps at its victim. Make an opposed roll with __**six** Base Dice__ against the target’s `CLOSE COMBAT` skill (not counting as an action for the victim):\n> If the Facehugger wins, the target will suffer **THE FINAL EMBRACE** (n°6) attack on the Facehugger’s next initiative.\n> If the victim wins they throw the beast to the floor, but it’s not finished with them yet and attacks the same target again on its next initiative.
6;THE FINAL EMBRACE;6;;0;The Facehugger gets to its victim, its acid making short work of any helmet or respirator in the way. Roll for the attack with __**six** Base Dice__. If it gets one or more ~success, the poor victim is facehugged and immediately Broken. Their last sensations are horrible, yet strangely loving: a firm but gentle caress around their head. A smothering sensation followed by a warm burst of oxygen-rich air filling their lungs. A deep sensation of slow-motion falling. It’s okay to fall asleep…
