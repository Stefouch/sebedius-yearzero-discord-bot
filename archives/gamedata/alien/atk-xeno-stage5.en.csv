1;ASSESSING THE THREAT;;;2;;The Xenomorph pauses, hissing quietly but all the more threatening for that. It looks like it’s thinking, or maybe giving silent orders to unseen companions. Everyone within `MEDIUM` range gets **+1** `STRESS LEVEL`.
2;ONE FOR ALL;;;1;;The Xeno leaps at the largest group of enemies and roars a challenge, sweeping its arms, legs and tail through their ranks. All targets within `SHORT` range must succeed at a `MOBILITY` roll or be knocked off their feet, taking one point of damage. All the targets must make immediate __Panic Roll__.
3;ALL-OUT ATTACK;12;2;0;;The Xenomorph launches into a wild attack, throwing every claw, fang and its pointed tail at its victim. It attacks with __**twelve** Base Dice, Damage **2**__, and the attack is armor piercing.
4;CAPTURE FOR THE HIVE;12;(1);0;;The Xenomorph attacks with its venom-spiked tail, with __**twelve** Base Dice, Damage **1**__. If the attack causes any damage, the Xeno pulls its punch so only one point of damage is inflicted, and the __paralyzing venom__ takes effect. The victim must make a `STAMINA` roll—the number of ~success rolled is the number of Rounds they can stay up, then they fall unconscious for one Shift. The paralysis can be removed with a shot of adrenaline (a `MEDICAL AID` roll using a Medkit), but otherwise the Xeno will capture them for the egg chamber.
5;DIE FOR THE QUEEN;12;;1;;The Xenomorph, desperate to protect its hive and Queen, leaps towards an enemy, eviscerating itself as it does so. Its acid blood showers everywhere: all targets within `SHORT` range of the Xeno suffer an immediate __acid splash attack of **twelve** Base Dice__. **The Xeno dies**, squealing.
6;HEADBITE;10;2;0;64;The Xenomorph opens its outer jaws wide, and the deadly inner jaws lean out, gnashing in anticipation before snapping forwards. The attack is rolled with __**ten** Base Dice, Damage **2**__. If it causes any damage it automatically inflicts __critical injury **#64**__, killing the victim in one dreadful blow.
