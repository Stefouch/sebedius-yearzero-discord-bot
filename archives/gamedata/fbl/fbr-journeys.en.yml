    '11-13':
      - Sinksnow
      - >-
        The snow collapses beneath your feet and you sink deep
        into a crushing, white embrace. Everyone in the group
        must make a `MIGHT` roll. Failure means one point of damage
        to AGILITY and another `MIGHT` roll to break free. PCs who are
        not stuck can help. You must also find a way around the
        treacherous area and make no progress on the map this
        Quarter Day.
    '14-16':
      - Impassable Terrain
      - >-
        The way ahead is blocked by ice, snow or rocks. To pass
        the obstruction everyone in the group must make a
        `MIGHT` or `MOVE` roll. Failure means one point of damage to
        STRENGTH and another roll to pass. PCs who make the roll
        can help others. You make no progress on the map this
        Quarter Day.
    '21-23':
      - Lost
      - >-
        You have gotten lost and make no progress on the map
        this Quarter Day. The pathfinder must succeed at a `SURVIVAL`
        roll to find the way out of the hexagon. They may
        make one try per Quarter Day.
    '24-26':
      - Broken Gear
      - >-
        A PC’s ski or snowshoe breaks. They count as if traveling
        on foot until the gear is repaired with a `CRAFTING` roll.
    '31-33':
      - Cold Front
      - >-
        A cold front rolls in. Everyone in the group must make an
        `ENDURANCE` roll. Those who fail become COLD. This can be
        avoided by immediately `MAKING CAMP`, but that stops the
        journey for this Quarter Day.
    '34-36':
      - Avalanche
      - >-
        An avalanche rushes down upon you. Every PC must
        succeed at a `SURVIVAL`, `MOVE` or `MIGHT` roll to not be swept
        away by the oncoming snow. Each player decides for
        themselves which skill to use. A PC who fails is caught in
        the avalanche and suffers an attack with __**six** Base Dice and
        Weapon Damage **1**__ *(blunt trauma)* and becomes COLD. After
        this, the PC must make a `MIGHT` roll to break free from the
        snow. Anyone who gets stuck must make an `ENDURANCE`
        roll against the COLD every hour but also gets a chance to
        break free every hour.
    '41-43':
      - Blizzard
      - >-
        You see a dark wall of snow hurtling towards you, and
        you are soon caught in a violent blizzard. You are forced
        to make camp and lose your progress for this Quarter Day.
    '44-46':
      - Heavy Snowfall
      - >-
        You are surprised by dense snowfall. The distance you
        can cover this Quarter Day is decreased by one hexagon.
        If reduced to zero, you make no progress at all. All adventurers
        also suffer one point of damage to Empathy due to
        the despair of plodding through the heavy snowfall that
        never seems to stop.
    '51-53':
      - Snow blindness
      - >-
        The white ocean of snow and ice overwhelms your sight.
        Everything seems to disappear in a white haze. Every PC
        must succeed at a `SURVIVAL` roll to not be afflicted by snow
        blindness. Those who fail act as if in total darkness during
        the next Quarter Day.
    '54-56':
      - Fall
      - >-
        The pathfinder falls into a crevice in the ice or down a
        steep slope. A failed `MOVE` roll causes a random critical
        injury (blunt trauma). The crevice may lead to tunnels
        that let you keep hiking beneath the ice (see page 39) if
        the GM wishes.
    '61-63':
      - Ravenous wolves
      - >-
        You are attacked by D3 ravenous wolves (see page 126 in
        the Gamemaster’s Guide).
    '64-66':
      - Ruins!
      - >-
        You stumble across a previously undiscovered ruin!
        Whether or not this turns out to be lucky will soon
        become clear. The GM uses the tables in Chapter 12 to
        create adventure sites and bring the ruin to life.

    '1':
      - Broken Gear
      - >-
        Your ski or snowshoe breaks. It counts as if you are traveling
        on foot until the gear is repaired with a `CRAFTING` roll.
    '2':
      - Angry Birds
      - >-
        A colony of waddlerbirds defends their nests from intruding
        adventurers. No food is found, and the PC is soiled by
        the attacks of the waddlerbirds.
    '3':
      - Poisonous Roots
      - >-
        You find roots that correspond to one unit of `VEGETABLES`.
        The roots are poisonous, however, which you discover when
        you cook them. Anyone eating the roots must make an
        `ENDURANCE` roll against the hallucinogenic poison (__Potency **3**__).
    '4':
      - Wild Animal
      - >-
        You encounter a wolf, bear or other ferocious animal that feels
        threatened and attacks you. The GM selects a suitable animal
        from the table on page 126 in the Gamemaster’s Guide.
    '5':
      - Rotten Eggs
      - >-
        You find abandoned bird nests and may gather D6 eggs
        that would correspond to one unit of `VEGETABLES` if they
        were fresh. They are rotten, however, and stink to high
        heaven when cracked open. Creative players can surely
        find a use for them even if they are inedible.
    '6':
      - Ruins!
      - >-
        Your search has brought you to a ruin. Deeply absorbed
        in your own thoughts you fail to notice that the ruin is
        inhabited! An animal has made the location into its lair and
        intends to defend it against the intruder.

  name: Hunt
  roll: D6
  refs:
    '1':
      - Sprained ankle
      - >-
        You fall or twist your ankle and suffer a critical injury, equivalent
        to result 25-26 in the table for blunt trauma on page 197.
    '2':
      - Lost gear/weapon
      - You lose some of your hunting gear or a weapon. The GM decides which.
    '3':
      - Torn Clothes
      - >-
        Your clothes are damaged. Your boots break or your robe rips
        on thorny plants or sharp rocks. You must roll for for the effects of cold.
        Your clothes can be mended by making a successful `CRAFTING` roll.
    '4':
      - Trap
      - >-
        You step into another hunter’s trap. It could be a snare,
        a net, or a covered pit. You suffer one point of damage to
        Strength and must make a `MOVE` roll to get out of the trap.
    '5':
      - Savage Animal
      - >-
        A wolf, bear or other wild animal feels threatened, and attacks
        you. The GM chooses an animal from the table on page 124 of
        the Gamemaster’s Guide.
    '6':
      - Sick Prey
      - >-
        You bring down a random animal, but is sick and whoever eats
        of its flesh is infected by a disease with a __Virulence rating of **3**__.
        This is discovered during your next meal.

fishingMishaps:
  id: FBR_JOURNEY_MISHAP_FISH

  roll: D6
  refs:
    '1':
      - Snagged Hook or Net
      - >-
        Your hook or net snags on something. You must make a
        `MIGHT` roll to be able to retrieve your fishing gear.
    '2':
      - Hook in Finger
      - >-
        You succeed at getting your own finger caught on the hook
        instead of a fish. You suffer one point of damage to STRENGTH.
    '3':
      - Broken Gear
      - >-
        Your fishing equipment breaks. You must repair it with a
        `CRAFTING` roll or acquire new equipment.
    '4':
      - Overboard
      - >-
        You lose balance and fall into the water. See the rules for
        drowning on page 113 in the Player’s Handbook. If you survive
        and get out of the water, you still become COLD as per
        the rules on page 111 in the Player’s Handbook.
    '5':
      - Leak
      - >-
        If you are fishing from a boat, it springs a leak. The leak
        must be repaired with a `CRAFTING` roll before you can
        resume `FISHING`. If you are `FISHING` from the ice it cracks
        beneath you and you must make a `MOVE` roll to not fall into
        the water. See the rules for drowning and becoming COLD in
        the Player’s Handbook.
    '6':
      - Attack
      - >-
        A crab attacks you and cuts open a bleeding wound in your
        hand. You suffer one point of damage to Strength.

makingCampMishaps:
  id: FBR_JOURNEY_MISHAP_MAKE_CAMP
  name: Make Camp
  roll: D66
  refs:
    '11-13':
      - Lice
      - >-
        A random adventurer has gotten lice in their sleeping furs or in
        their clothes. They itch something fierce and the victim develops
        a red rash all over her body. The victim suffers one point of
        damage to Agility every day due to the scratching and is unable
        to `SLEEP`. A successful `HEALING` roll staves off the effect.
    '14-16':
      - Thieving Animals
      - >-
        A greedy weasel or waddlerbird has run off with a piece of
        gear. The GM decides what has been stolen. A successful
        `SCOUTING` roll reveals the animal’s nest, where the equipment is
        found together with two `SIMPLE CARRIED FINDS`.
    '21-23':
      - Bad Campsite
      - >-
        The campsite is poorly chosen and very uncomfortable to
        `SLEEP` in. No one gets any `SLEEP` until you find a new campsite.
    '24-26':
      - Fire Goes Out
      - >-
        You forget to feed the fire and it goes out. You lack adequate
        protection against the COLD for the night (see page 31).
    '31-33':
      - Heavy Snowfall
      - >-
        Heavy snowfall suddenly buries the camp. You must make a `MIGHT`
        roll (one rolls and the others may help) to get out from under the
        snow and your journey is delayed by a full Quarter Day.
    '34-36':
      - Mice
      - >-
        Mice have gotten into the food. Everyone in the party must
        lower their Resource Die for `FOOD` one step.
    '41-43':
      - Fire!
      - >-
        Suddenly, the flames from your campfire spread out of control.
        Your tents, sleeping furs and other gear all catch fire.
        Each adventurer suffers an attack with __**five** Base Dice (Weapon
        Damage **1**)__. Each adventurer must also make a `MOVE` roll to save
        their gear. Failure means that one piece of equipment (the GM
        decides which) is lost in the fire.
    '44-46':
      - Herd of Reindeer
      - >-
        A herd of reindeer passes close to or through the camp and
        chaos ensues! It is impossible to `REST` or `SLEEP` this Quarter Day.
    '51-53':
      - Howling Wolves
      - >-
        Wolves howl throughout the night in the wastes surrounding your
        camp. This Quarter Day doesn’t count towards your need to `SLEEP`.
    '54-56':
      - Broken Gear
      - >-
        An item belonging to a random PC breaks when you `MAKE CAMP`.
        The GM decides what breaks. The piece of equipment may be
        repaired by a successful `CRAFTING` roll.
    '61-63':
      - Wild Animal
      - >-
        A bear, a couple of wolves or some other wild animal feels
        threatened and attacks the camp. The GM selects a suitable
        animal from the table on page 126 in the Gamemaster’s Guide.
    '64-66':
      - Haunted Site
      - >-
        The campsite is haunted by spirits from the age of the winter
        elves. They chatter and scream at you in your dreams and this
        Quarter Day doesn’t count towards your need for `SLEEP`.

    '3':
      - Sea Monster
      - >-
        The wake from a sea monster makes the boat lurch. Everyone
        onboard must succeed at a `MOVE` roll to not lose their balance and
        fall into the water. See the rules for drowning on page 113 in the
        Player’s Handbook. Anyone who falls overboard also becomes COLD.
    '4':
      - Leak
      - >-
        The boat is attacked by a Pikebeast and springs a leak. The leak
        must be repaired with a `CRAFTING` roll before you may continue

        after D6 Quarter Hours.
    '5':
      - Submerged Obstacle
      - >-
        Your boat collides with an iceberg or some other object hidden
        beneath the surface of the water, and must be abandoned or

        sea ice or on land to be repaired.
    '6':
      - Stuck in the Ice
      - >-
        Your boat gets stuck in the heavy ice. Someone may hack the
        boat free, with the help of others, by succeeding at a `MIGHT` roll.
