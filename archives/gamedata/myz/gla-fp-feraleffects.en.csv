ref;effect
1;The beast takes complete control and you are temporarily controlled by the GM as an NPC. You lose both your ability to speak and to use tools (see 3 and 4, below). You immediately run away into the wilderness and must Fight whoever tries to stop you. You regain control of your character only when someone Heals you – but that is only possible after D6 hours. Once you regain your senses you have developed another animal power of your choosing.
2;You must immediately either run away or Fight against an individual of your choosing, friend or foe, until you or your opponent is broken. After that, you lose your ability to speak and to use tools (see 3 and 4, below).
3;You temporarily lose your capacity for coherent, logical thinking. This means you lose the ability to speak as outlined in 4 below, but you are also completely unable to use tools. You also lose the ability to use the skill Comprehend. The effect lasts D6 days.
4;You lose the ability to form human words and can only communicate through primitive animal sounds. You can still use all your skills. To simulate this effect, you as a player should also stop speaking, other than to describe the actions of your animal. After D6 days you regain the ability to speak.
5;Your animal side is completely suppressed and your human side takes over. This means you lose all your FP and are unable to gain more. You can push as usual, but won’t gain any FP. You cannot use the Dominate skill. The effect lasts D6 days.
6;You connect with your inner beast, and for a moment it acts in perfect harmony with your human side. You regain the FP you just spent, and can immediately, in the same turn, activate the same power again – with the same purpose as the first time, or another.
