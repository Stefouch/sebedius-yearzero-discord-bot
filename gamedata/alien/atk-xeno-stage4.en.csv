1;HYPNOTIZING GAZE;;;;;The Xenomorph, eyeless as it may seem, stares deeply into the soul of its victim. The victim is mesmerized by the dread beauty of such a beast. They stand in awe of what nature, or god, or the devil has created, get **+1** `STRESS LEVEL` and must make an immediate __Panic Roll__.
2;PLAYING WITH ITS PREY;;;0;;The Xeno attacks, but not to kill. The target is knocked to the ground and drops all hand-held items, but otherwise takes no damage. The Xeno morph stands over them, taunting its prey to run so the game can go on. The victim gets **+1** `STRESS LEVEL` and must make an immediate __Panic Roll__.
3;DEADLY GRAB;10;1;0;;The beast launches through the air, grabbing its victim. It attacks with __**ten** Base Dice, Damage **1**__. If it hits it immediately drags them into a neighboring zone, dumping them on the floor. The victim is prone, drops all hand-held items and must make an immediate __Panic Roll__.
4;READY TO KILL;10;;0;;The Xenomorph grabs its victim, its inner jaws poised to strike. Roll for the attack with __**ten** Base Dice__. If it hits, the victim counts as grabbed (see page 93) and needs to make an opposed `CLOSE COMBAT` roll against __**ten** Base Dice__ to break loose. The victim and all friendly characters in the same zone must make __Panic Rolls__. Unless the victim breaks free, the Xenomorph will use a **HEADBITE** attack (n°6) against them on its next initiative.
5;CAPTURE FOR THE HIVE;10;{1};0;;The Xenomorph attacks with its venom-spiked tail, with __**ten** Base Dice, Damage **1**__. If the attack causes any damage, the Xeno pulls its punch so only one point of damage is inflicted, and the __paralyzing venom__ takes effect. The victim must make a `STAMINA` roll—the number of {success} rolled is the number of Rounds they can stay up, then they fall unconscious for one Shift. The paralysis can be removed with a shot of adrenaline (a `MEDICAL AID` roll using a Medkit).
6;HEADBITE;9;2;0;64;The Xenomorph opens its outer jaws wide, and the deadly inner jaws lean out, gnashing in anticipation before snapping forwards. The attack has a strength of __**nine** Base Dice, Damage **2**__. If it causes any damage it automatically inflicts __critical injury **#64**__, killing the victim in one dreadful blow. However, should the GM wish it, the victim remains just alive enough for the Xeno morph to initiate the ovomorphing process.
