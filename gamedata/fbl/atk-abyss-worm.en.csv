2;UNEARTHLY ROAR;5;;1;The beast lets out a horrible roar that strikes all adventurers within `NEAR` range with a __fear attack with **five** Base Dice__.
3;THE SKY DARKENS;12;2;1;The giant worm rises into the sky and blocks the sun with its huge mass. Then it lets its body fall onto the adventurers to crush them.
