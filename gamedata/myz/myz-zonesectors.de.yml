      - >-
        A huge metal tube lies broken and crushed on the ground. It is scorched
        by fire and inside there are rows of ancient seats, all blackened by
        flames. Stretching away from the tube, the ground is scorched and all
        houses destroyed, as if the tube had come crashing from the sky at
        incredible speed.
    '12':
      - Amusement Park
      - >-
        A bizarre huddle of rusting machines and decrepit large tents, in colors
        that once were stark. The remains of the tent cloth flaps in the wind.
        On a picture, a man with a white face and a large red nose smiles at
        you. One machine is a large wooden disc with plastic horses mounted on
        it. The disc is placed on a motor and seems to have been able to rotate.
    '13':
      - Battlefield
      - >-
        This area is completely devastated. Rusty rebars protrude from broken
        blocks of concrete that once were the walls of homes. The ruins are
        scorched by explosions and riddled with bullet holes. Small craters
        pockmark the ground.
    '14':
      - Bus Station
      - >-
        Among flaking road signs with illegible numbers and letters, several big
        old motor vehicles stand rusting away. Some have two decks, others have
        an accordion-like contraption in the middle and can bend. The Ancients’
        machines are truly mysterious.
    '15':
      - Car Park
      - >-
        The concrete pillars have given in and the entire, circular building has
        collapsed like an accordion pressed together. In the debris, lots of
        motor vehicles from the Old Age are buried. Maybe some of them could be
        repaired?
    '16':
      - Church
      - >-
        The ancient spire on the stone building reaches far into the sky, its
        sharp point lost in the Zone haze. Inside, there are rows of rotten
        wooden benches, all turned toward the figure of a man hanging on a
        cross. The Ancients used to come here to talk to their Boss in the sky.
        Now, all is quiet. If there is a god, it has abandoned this place long
        ago. Comment: This ruin can of course be replaced by a temple or a
        mosque, if that fits better with your campaign environment.
    '21':
      - Cinema
      - >-
        Next to a large entrance leading into the dark interior of this
        building, a number of yellowing posters hang in huge frames. Each of the
        posters depict dramatic motifs from the Old Age. In this cavernous
        building, the Ancients watched moving images on a screen.
    '22':
      - Crater
      - >-
        A gigantic hole appears in the ground, at least 50 yards across. Some
        ancient weapon of annihilation must have struck here, destroying
        everything nearby. In the bottom of the crater, there is a small lake of
        greenish rotwater.
    '23':
      - Dilapidated Mansion
      - >-
        This dark and decrepit house was old even before the Fall. It’s built of
        wood and stone and has somehow managed to withstand the decades of
        neglect. What could be hidden inside its dark halls?
    '24':
      - Fast Food Joint
      - >-
        A large M in the shape of two dirty yellow arcs adorn the facade of this
        ruined building. There are many facilities like this in the Zone. What
        used to be in them no one knows any longer, but Stalkers tend to avoid
        them because of the strong Rot inside.
    '25':
      - Gas Station
      - >-
        Underneath an open roof next to a low house, a number of car wrecks are
        left to rust. Next to them there are machines with hoses and faucets.
        Anyone who knows his way around the Zone knows that this is a place
        where the Ancients repaired their vehicles and filled them up with fuel.
    '26':
      - Highway
      - >-
        The concrete is cracked and the markings on the road surface are all but
        worn away. Before the Fall, the Ancients would whizz by here at
        incredible speeds in their shiny motor carriages. Now, the old cars
        stand by the roadside, burnt out and rusted beyond repair.
    '31':
      - Hospital
      - >-
        When the Apocalypse came, the Ancients flooded this concrete hulk of a
        building, desperately hoping to be saved. Now, this is a crumbling ruin.
        Decayed corpses lie everywhere in rooms and hallways, on beds and on the
        floors.
    '32':
      - Hunting Store
      - >-
        Among the decrepit shelves in this place you can find fishing poles,
        hooks and lines. A skilled Stalker can use these items to find edible
        fish in the Zone waters (page 56). On the walls, yellowed pictures of
        rifles hang. In one corner, there is a heavy metal locker tall as a
        mutant – perhaps there is something valuable in there?
    '33':
      - Mall
      - >-
        A city within a city reveals itself, huge halls with ancient shops and
        restaurants in several levels. Everything in here is scorched by fire
        long ago and covered in soot, but perhaps something valuable is hidden
        among the ashes? Here and there strange plastic figures stand in strange
        poses, as if preaching to a crowd.
    '34':
      - Marina
      - >-
        Just off the shore, a great number of boat wrecks lie half sunken in the
        rotwater. Sailing boats, motor boats and canoes that the Ancients used
        for recreation have turned into a dangerous reef of cracked plastic and
        metal beams.
    '35':
      - Museum
      - >-
        Large steps in broken stone lead up to this grand building. Inside,
        there are dark halls with strange items from the Old Age and even ages
        before that, all showcased for the Ancients to see.
    '36':
      - Office Building
      - >-
        In this dark ruin you can find large halls, all filled with identical
        tables in small booths. On the floor, there are yellowed papers
        everywhere. Before the Fall, important work was probably done here. Now,
        the Zone dust blows in through the broken windows.
    '41':
      - Overgrown Park
      - >-
        Tall trees and thick bushes grow wild here and have completely overgrown
        the area. Benches, walking paths and fountains are hidden by thick weeds
        and the lawns are turned into marshlands. There are many rumors about
        the creatures that roam the old parks in the Zone.
    '42':
      - Playground
      - >-
        Car tires hang in rusty chains from a metal frame. A wooden sandbox has
        turned into a stinking pool of mud. Acid Rains have gnawed holes in the
        metal slides long ago. Here, the Ancients played with their children. A
        few cracked plastic toys have survived the decades of wear and still lie
        abandoned in the sand.
    '43':
      - Police Station
      - >-
        Outside of this large building, wrecks of identical blue and white cars
        are rusting away. The tires and long since gone, but the blue plastic
        lamps on their roofs are still there. In the basement of the building,
        there are rooms that cannot be opened from the inside.
    '44':
      - Radio Station
      - >-
        A forest of rusty antennae and metal discs protrude from the roof of
        this massive building. A sign on the facade shows an antenna with rings
        around it.
    '45':
      - Residential Blocks
      - >-
        Several identical tall buildings, made of concrete that is now cracked
        and crumbling. On the ground between these monoliths, there are rotted
        benches and tall weeds. Car wrecks are everywhere, most rusted beyond
        repair. Each of the buildings has a large number of identical
        apartments. Inside, you can find decrepit furniture, clothes and other
        items.
    '46':
      - Road Tunnel
      - >-
        The entrance to this broad tunnel looks like the maw of an enormous
        beast. Outside, an innumerable amount of cars, trucks and buses stand
        tightly packed together, slowly rusting into nothing. Whatever horror
        the occupants of these vehicles were fleeing from, it is obvious few
        survived.
    '51':
      - Ruined Bridge
      - >-
        The remains of a majestic bridge rise tall in the Zone haze. It has
        collapsed in both directions and only two thick pillars remain, but if
        you can climb up onto the remaining roadway you’ll have a great lookout
        position.
    '52':
      - School
      - >-
        On the crumbling brick facade of this building hangs a clock that
        stopped long ago. Below it someone has written text on the wall, no
        longer legible. On the concrete ground in front of the building there
        are two rusty metal rods, each a little taller than a mutant and with a
        metal ring at the top.
    '53':
      - Shelter
      - >-
        A massive rusty metal door in the rockside leads deep underground. Down
        there, the Ancients sought refuge from the horrors on the surface. Now,
        it’s a perfect place to look for artifacts. But who knows what’s lurking
        down here, who else might have found this dungeon full of treasure?
    '54':
      - Skyscraper
      - >-
        A tall building rises toward the yellow haze of the Zone sky. The
        concrete is withered and broken, and all of the hundreds of windows have
        fallen from their frames long ago. Now, the Zone wind blows right
        through the many floors of this majestic building. Every floor is filled
        by small and identical apartments or offices. Only the top floor looks
        different, with bigger and more luxurious accommodations – if you can
        get all the way up there…
    '55':
      - Sports Center
      - >-
        A large, spacious hall made of rusty corrugated steel. Inside, there are
        strange objects like thick mattresses covered in red plastic, large nets
        on frames, clubs with holes in them and balls in all colors and sizes.
        They say the Ancients went to places like this to exercise.
    '56':
      - Suburbia
      - >-
        A street with identical small houses in even rows on each side. The
        grass and bushes have withered away long ago, everything is covered in
        ashes. Inside the houses, decomposing clothes and other personal items
        remain. The inhabitants must have left in a hurry. Car wrecks, and other
        remains from the Ancients who used to live here, abound. Much has
        decayed over time and some of the houses have completely collapsed.
    '61':
      - Subway Station
      - >-
        By a stairway leading down into the underground a large sign with
        flaking paint hangs. All Stalkers know what this sign means. This is an
        entrance to the tunnels under the Zone. In the deeps, terrible dangers
        await – but perhaps also many untouched artifacts.
    '62':
      - Supermarket
      - >-
        A grand building rises among the ruins. Its large windows were broken
        many decades ago, and the Zone dust drifts in unhindered. Before the
        Fall, this building housed an unimaginable amount of food, drink,
        kitchen utensils and other things that the Ancients consumed at a
        dizzying rate. Now, most of it is looted, burnt or decayed.
    '63':
      - Swimming Hall
      - >-
        Inside this large ruin, there are big pools filled with mud and slimy
        algae. Noxious and toxic fumes meet anyone who enters. It’s hard to
        imagine that the Ancients went here voluntarily to bathe in the pools.
    '64':
      - Tank
      - >-
        A massive and awe-inspiring metal vehicle blocks the path. Its enormous
        tracks have rusted stuck long ago and no death or destruction has spewed
        out from its cannon for many decades, but coming close to this metal
        beast still strikes fear into the heart of almost any Zone wanderer.
    '65':
      - Theater
      - >-
        Inside of this dark ruin is a great hall, filled with rows of seats
        facing a large stage with a grand red curtain. The Ancients came here to
        see singing, dancing and stage plays.
    '66':
      - Train Station
      - >-
        Ancient railway cars stand rusting on overgrown tracks. In these, the
        Ancients used to travel quickly and effectively all across the Zone and
        beyond. Now, the only passengers are decaying corpses.

      - Factory

        The metal roof of this large, flat building has caved in long ago.
        Inside, there are machines and strange vehicles with huge forks in the
        front. Everything in here is ravaged by decades of rain and wind. Some
        rusty old barrels have fallen over and a greenish sludge has leaked out
        onto the floor.
    '14-16':
      - Military Base
      - >-
        A large square courtyard with brick buildings on each side. In the
        buildings, there are a great number of identical rooms with metal bunk
        beds. Beyond these buildings there is a large garage with several burnt
        out vehicles inside.
    '21-23':
      - Oil Cistern
      - >-
        This large cylinder-shaped metal building has a narrow stairway winding
        its way around the outside wall, all the way to the top. Up there, you
        could spot any threats from a safe distance. The building contains a
        huge tank filled by a sticky, black liquid. A Gearhead could use this as
        fuel. The problem is just getting it out…
    '24-26':
      - Pipeline
      - >-
        A thick rusty metal pipe runs through this part of the Zone. It’s wide
        enough for a mutant to crawl through. The gas and oil has stopped
        flowing through these pipes long ago. Now, they can only serve as scrap.
    '31-33':
      - Purification Plant
      - >-
        The stench intensifies for each and every step closer to this building.
        But Stalkers know that the smell of decay can hide an invaluable
        treasure. These large pools, tanks and machines purified the Ancients’
        drinking water. Could there still be clean water in any of the tanks?
    '34-36':
      - Power Line
      - >-
        A tall tower made of rusty metal beams rises into the Zone sky. It has
        collapsed halfway up, and the sharp spire has folded down toward the
        ground. Thick cables, that once supplied electricity to the entire Zone,
        now lie draped across the ground.
    '41-43':
      - Radio Mast
      - >-
        A tall metal mast rises high above the zonescape. It is held up by thick
        metal wires, and at the top big rusty antennae sprout. Once, wireless
        transmissions were sent from here to the people of the Old Age, for
        their amusement and education. Now, there is nothing to hear but the
        Zone wind.
    '44-46':
      - Refinery
      - >-
        An entire landscape full of rusting and decaying machinery covers this
        part of the Zone. Enormous tanks are connected by metal tubes, some wide
        enough for a mutant to crawl through. If you dare, you can climb through
        these metallic deadlands on ladders, girders and walkways.
    '51-53':
      - Rubbish Dump
      - >-
        A mountain of trash blocks your path. Here, the Ancients dumped
        everything they didn’t need. Most has been ground to dust by the passage
        of time, but plastic items and large chunks of rusty metal protrude from
        the heap.
    '54-56':
      - Shipwreck
      - >-
        A big rusty ship lies wrecked just off the shore, half sunken beneath
        the waves. The empty portholes make the ship look like a huge beached
        whale. Could there still be useful scrap in the engine room?
    '61-63':
      - Shooting Range
      - >-
        Empty shell casings litter this large open area. In one end, there is a
        large earthwork with lots of pockmarks from bullets. In a shed close by
        there are targets in the shape of humans and animals. In the Old Age,
        they could afford to spend bullets on shooting at paper figures.
    '64-66':
      - Windmill
      - >-
        A thin, white tower rises tall over the zonelands. At the top, a huge
        propeller is mounted. They say the Ancients started to build windmills
        like this one to get energy when the oil in the ground started to run
        out. It was much too late, of course.
