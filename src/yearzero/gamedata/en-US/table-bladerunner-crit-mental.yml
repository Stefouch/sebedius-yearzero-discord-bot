1:
  name: To Live In Fear
  effect: You’re paralyzed by fear or indecision. You just can’t force yourself to do anything at all, even to the point of putting your own life in jeopardy due to your inaction.
2:
  name: Too Bad She Won’t Live
  effect: You break down in despair – roleplay this effect as appropriate for the situation. During the breakdown, you can move to safety, but you can’t perform any action that would require a skill roll.
3:
  name: No Choice, Pal
  effect: You surrender to whatever obstacle you are facing. In combat or conflict, you surrender to your adversary. In other situations, you just give up – see result #2 on this table.
  call: 2
4:
  name: Tell Him I’m Eating
  effect: You lash out against a friendly or neutral character nearby. This could very well be another PC, and the row could even turn violent. The effect needs to be roleplayed.
5:
  name: Twice As Quit
  effect: You can’t take it anymore and just leave the scene, to go home, get drunk, get laid, or just wander the streets. You can’t actively work on the case or make any skill rolls.
6:
  name: Shakes? Me Too
  effect: You get the shakes, bad ones. You can continue to function, but with a disadvantage to all skill rolls, and no rolls can be pushed.
